2. **Technologies Used**  
   - **Programming Language**: Python  
   - **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow and Keras
   - **Libraries**:   
     - *NLTK* and *spaCy* for preprocessing   
     - *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* for visualizations   
     - *Pandas* and *NumPy* for data handling  
   - **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab 

3. **Model Architecture**  
   - **LSTM Network**:  
     - Embedded layers to represent text as dense vectors.  
     - LSTM layers to capture the sequential nature of the text.  
     - Fully connected layers with softmax activation for classification.  
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized learning rate, batch size, and dropout rates for better generalization.  

4. **Methodology**  
   - **Data Preprocessing**:  
     - Conversion of text data into numerical sequences using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.  
   - **Model Training**:  
     - Train-test split to validate the model's performance.  
     - Use of cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer.

5. **Results and Insights**  
   - LSTM provided a significant boost in accuracy due to its ability to understand context and sequence.  
   - Key sentiment trends and themes were identified in positive and negative reviews.  

6. **Challenges Addressed**  
   - Overfitting mitigated through dropout layers and regularization techniques.  
   - Balancing sequence length to avoid loss of critical context.  

7. **Future Scope**  
   - Implementation of bidirectional LSTMs for better context understanding.
